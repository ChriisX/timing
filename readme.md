# Timing

Timing is a chrome extension that allows the user to watch his navigation time for each day :watch:

## Installation

As the extension is not on the Chrome Web Store (yet?), you'll have to install it manually.

- First download the repository.
- Then activate the developer mode on chrome. To do so, go to the [extensions](chrome://extensions) page and turn on the switch button in the upper-right corner of the page.
- Click "load unpacked" and choose the folder that contains the project
